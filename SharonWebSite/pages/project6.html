                    Sewing project makes widows and their children self sustainable.
                    We give short term sewing training and a sewing machine for free of cost.
                    They will acquire basic skills in sewing to make some money out of that.
                    Tribal women and girls are most of them that attend this training.
                    This is a "feeding of familiy" for most of the families that attend training.
                    Some of them have choosen this as their career that impresses us.
                    Please contact us to sponser this project.
