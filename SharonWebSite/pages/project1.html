                <p>
                    Sharon Bible College was started in the year 2005. This is our main project. 
                    Many tribal students are getting trained every year. After training they go back to thier own tribal villages and 
                    preach the Gospel to their own group. 
                    Students are given admission after keen observation. Along with theoritical training they are aslo trained in Outreach.
                    We also help the students in the church establishments by morally, physically and economically.
                    Certificates in theology training will be distributed to the students on successful completion of the course.
                    These certificates are valied through out India.
                    Sharon Bible course is offered freely without any fee from the students.
                    If God gives an inspiration to help this project, please contact us.
