                    This project gives safe water to families who needs to walk miles to get some drinking water.
                    There are many villages which lack minimum water facilities.
                    We dig bore wells in villages where there is no safe water.

                    When ever there is enough fund to sponser for water well then village with critical need for water is selected.
                    Results have shown that there is good improvement in health conditions of the villages.
