                <p>
                    We conduct village evangelism where we select a village per week and reach the people of the village with the Good News.
                    We distribute tracks, we sing on the roads, we preach in the open places, we talk one-to-one, by projecter we play Jesus movies and use all the possible ways to reach the Unreached.
                    We conduct crusades at diffrent places through out the year. Main crusade of Sharon will be conducted in Manuguru with the aim of renewing our strength in Jesus.
                    Many will accept Jesus in these meetings. People from long distances attend these meetings.
                    Crusades gives an oppertunity for unreached to listen Gospel.
                    If you would like to participate by preaching, singing, sharing testimony or in other ways, you are welcome!.
