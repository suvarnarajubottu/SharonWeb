                <p>We believe in Jesus Christ as saviour, We preach Gospel in the places where people do not heard. 
                The main objective of the church planting is to reach the Unreached with Gospel, save lives and turn them to Jesus.
                People in those areas have changed alot, they quit smoking, alcohol and many other bad habits. 
                We send a pastor and his family to that areas who will work for them.
                Right now we serving with 18 churches, and many more need one. 
                There is a desperate need for the accomodation of those pastor and family.
                We conduct pastors conference every year at Manuguru so that the pastors get new strength.
                Our vision is to construct 100 churches in the next 5 years.
                Please pray for this project and extend your help by some contributions.
