                <p>
                    This project is to send the tribal children who can not attend school becauses of poverty.
                    Children work in the forest along with their parents without attending school. 
                    Many children sit home with out attending school because they can not afford the school fee.
                    They need to walk some miles to attend the school. It will be vey difficult in the rainy seasons.
                    We talk with parents and explain the importance of education. We are also supporting such children by paying their school fees.
                    Many are recognising the importance and sending their children to school. 
                    Students going to school are doing well in their studies.
                    Many children have to pre-univeristy, univerisity education.
                    Some of them are becoming teachers, nurses, IT operators.
                    Its great to see these tribal children excelling and helping their own community after education.
                    If you would like to share some of our burden, please contact us.
